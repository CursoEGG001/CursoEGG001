# Welcome to CursoEGG001 ðŸ‘‹

This profile is owned by a former student from EGG Cooperation with the intent of develop the necessary skills to become the king of the developers an exploring the Grand Programers universe.
Maybe its notorious how the differents repositories were implemented because the course includes only the most basic management of GIT.

For people that already did the different course that improved later in the service, you could feel it has no better content than other things.

You can find a Basic course through programing from zero to a minimal Fullstack development here, as requiered by Argentina Programa 4.0 scholarship from Argentina as well as an elemental implementation of Spring 3.1.5 for a minimal site with necessary help for many Spring Framework users.
Given the time used for the full course, it is really basic but esential in the understanding of how the different stances of programing works, logic usage and minimal abstractions requiered for an implementation of the different programs from the evolving stages 

## Choose the repo based on the numbers ðŸ‘€
The repos are part of different excercises and even a bit expanded with some inferences, so choose the ones with less complexity if you want to understand something.

As it is made through the differents levels, you will find some elemental things about Fullstack with no explanations whatsoever

## Why is it here

Because of my ignorance, I tried the identity of an user as a general repository place and didnÂ´t wish to change the user name. That developed in a repository with the full course being splice in different repos. That could help if yyou are learning programming in some way but difficult the development if you just copy because it can't work except for the last repos that clearly have the proper placement for things in a repo and make the program accesible.
As with many things, its just a bare example of programming and can't be taken for complete in any case, much of it just functionnin to show the excercise and none with full capability deployed.

## Enjoy as much as possible

Programming requieres extensive exploration of possibilities and complete concentration in conseqences because when starting you don't know how a programming languaje is fixed on some concepts and different languajes take priorities on errors or proccesing. In this user you can see how was used Java and even JavaScript. Is even a full repo with SQL requierements that possibly fail because there are no database created at all. So observe what can help you inmmediatly after a trouble. Don't take for granted what you think as it can change just because updates in the Languaje references.
